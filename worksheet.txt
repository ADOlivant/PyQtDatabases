Code Questions 
--------------

1. Why has the code for the AddCustomerWidget been separated into its own file?

	- To aid readibility of the code. 
	- To reduce the amount of code within one document
	- To reuse the code in further projects within similar 'add customers' functions.

2. How does the AddCustomerWidget communicate with the ShopWindow widget?

	It communicates with the use of signals when certain function calls need to be run.

3. Why has the code for the SQLConnection object been separated into its own file?

	- To aid readibility of the code. 
	- To reduce the amount of code within one document
	- To reuse the code in further projects within similar SQL databases functions.

4. What does a QAction represent?

	The QAction class provides an abstract user interface action that can be inserted into widgets.
	In applications many common commands can be invoked via menus, toolbar buttons, and keyboard shortcuts. 
	Since the user expects each command to be performed in the same way, regardless of the user interface used, 
	it is useful to represent each command as an action.

5. How could the code for the QActions be improved? You may need to refer to the PyQt documentation.

	To include a keyboard shortcut for the buttons.
